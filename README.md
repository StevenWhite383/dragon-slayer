-=[THINGS TO KNOW]=-

Please make sure to read each part carefully.
    While great care has been taken in making sure the game is as intuitive and as user-friendly as possible,
    there are times when a hasty input could cost you dearly.

Press Enter
    If you find yourself staring at a piece of text that does not ask for an input, try pressing 'Enter'.
    Often times, the game waits for the user to press enter so it can show more text.
    This is so the user is not given a giant wall of text at once, and instead, it is given in parts.

Inventory
    Not sure what an item in your inventory does? Try using it while not in battle!
    The game will give you a short description of the item - and some items are
    extremely useful.

-=[IMPLEMENTED FEATURES]=-

Despite the setbacks during development (see Ambitious Plans), Dragon Slayer currently has
a lot of in-depth features.
These include:

    Multiple characters which have different stats, items and abilities;

    A working inventory system which you can access at almost any time,
        add items to it, use items, check the description of items,
        see your name, class, level and gold;

    Random encounters that include puzzles, fights or item checks.
        Some of these encounters change depending on which character you are;

    Dynamic dialogue that changes depending on whether you have visited an area before;

    A fully working battle system which rewards gold, items and/or experience.
        Different characters have different attack and defence values, as well as
        the different items you can use in battle;

    A fully working levelling up system which increases your damage and maximum
        health when you gain enough experience;
    
    Optional gambling mini-games where you can earn (or lose) gold;

    A hub area that can be revisited. In this area you can talk to the NPCs, buy items,
        and upgrade your weapons. Upgraded weapons do more damage.

-=[AMBITIOUS PLANS]=-

Due to various reasons, Dragon Slayer is unfortunately still in a very early stage.
Currently the game only has 1 proper, fleshed-out level with the *option* to carry on
to level 2.
These reasons include, but are not limited to:

    Losing a team member at the start;
    One team member not being in for 2 days;
    Being too ambitious during the planning phase;
    Inexperiece of coding in a team;
    General coding inexperience.

Despite all these set-backs, we believe we have created a pretty good demo of what Dragon Slayer could be,
and with more time, we think this could be a fun experience with replayability and an impressive scope.
Initially, we planned to have four levels, with the fourth being a boss battle.
In levels two and three, the player would run into one of the other characters and have the choice to
recruit them or fight them.
If the player had bought a specific item from the town that the other character wanted, they could
recruit them, if not, a fight would start immediately.
See the flow chart for what was planned.
As of writing, only the start and level one has been included.

-=[UNUSED FEATURES]=-

Since we had such a short time to develop this game, and our ambitions were unreachable, we have a lot of code
that could not be used. We wanted to get the game into a state that was actually playable and represented
what Dragon Slayer would be through-out the whole game: The depth and detail is an important part of
Dragon Slayer and we wanted this to be done properly before adding more content.
The code for all these unused features can be found in the CodeNation Teams chat, Desk 3, Files tab,
if you have access to that.
The unused features are as follows:

    A lot of ASCII art;
    Dialogue between the characters;
    More puzzles and riddles;
    A detailed boss battle.

Thank you for reading and we hope you enjoy the game.
Please take your time to explore the different characters and choices the game presents you with.
