-=[THINGS TO KNOW]=-<br>

Please make sure to read each part carefully.<br>
    While great care has been taken in making sure the game is as intuitive and as user-friendly as possible,
    there are times when a hasty input could cost you dearly.<br>

Press Enter<br>
    If you find yourself staring at a piece of text that does not ask for an input, try pressing 'Enter'.<br>
    Often times, the game waits for the user to press enter so it can show more text.<br>
    This is so the user is not given a giant wall of text at once, and instead, it is given in parts.<br>

Inventory<br>
    Not sure what an item in your inventory does? Try using it while not in battle!<br>
    The game will give you a short description of the item - and some items are
    extremely useful.<br>

-=[IMPLEMENTED FEATURES]=-<br>

Despite the setbacks during development (see Ambitious Plans), Dragon Slayer currently has
a lot of in-depth features.<br>
These include:<br>

    Multiple characters which have different stats, items and abilities;

    A working inventory system which you can access at almost any time,
        add items to it, use items, check the description of items,
        see your name, class, level and gold;

    Random encounters that include puzzles, fights or item checks.
        Some of these encounters change depending on which character you are;

    Dynamic dialogue that changes depending on whether you have visited an area before;

    A fully working battle system which rewards gold, items and/or experience.
        Different characters have different attack and defence values, as well as
        the different items you can use in battle;

    A fully working levelling up system which increases your damage and maximum
        health when you gain enough experience;
    
    Optional gambling mini-games where you can earn (or lose) gold;

    A hub area that can be revisited. In this area you can talk to the NPCs, buy items,
        and upgrade your weapons. Upgraded weapons do more damage.

-=[AMBITIOUS PLANS]=-<br>

Due to various reasons, Dragon Slayer is unfortunately still in a very early stage.
Currently the game only has 1 proper, fleshed-out level with the *option* to carry on
to level 2.<br>
These reasons include, but are not limited to:<br>

    Losing a team member at the start;
    One team member not being in for 2 days;
    Being too ambitious during the planning phase;
    Inexperiece of coding in a team;
    General coding inexperience.

Despite all these set-backs, we believe we have created a pretty good demo of what Dragon Slayer could be,
and with more time, we think this could be a fun experience with replayability and an impressive scope.<br>
Initially, we planned to have four levels, with the fourth being a boss battle.<br>
In levels two and three, the player would run into one of the other characters and have the choice to
recruit them or fight them.<br>
If the player had bought a specific item from the town that the other character wanted, they could
recruit them, if not, a fight would start immediately.<br>
See the flow chart for what was planned.<br>
As of writing, only the start and level one has been included.<br>

-=[UNUSED FEATURES]=-<br>

Since we had such a short time to develop this game, and our ambitions were unreachable, we have a lot of code
that could not be used. We wanted to get the game into a state that was actually playable and represented
what Dragon Slayer would be through-out the whole game: The depth and detail is an important part of
Dragon Slayer and we wanted this to be done properly before adding more content.<br>
The code for all these unused features can be found in the CodeNation Teams chat, Desk 3, Files tab,
if you have access to that.<br>
The unused features are as follows:<br>

    A lot of ASCII art;
    Dialogue between the characters;
    More puzzles and riddles;
    A detailed boss battle.

Please take your time to explore the different characters and choices the game presents you with.<br>
